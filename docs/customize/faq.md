# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

The following are some common issues and questions that have arisen when
building your textbook with Jupyter-Book.

## How can I include interactive Plotly figures?

To display interactive [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) figures, they must
first be generated in a Jupyter notebook using the [offline mode](https://plot.ly/python/offline/).
You must then plot the figure with `plotly.offline.plot()`, which generates an HTML file (`plotly.offline.iplot()` does not),
and then load the HTML into the notebook with `display(HTML('file.html'))` prior to saving your *.ipynb file.

e.g.

```python
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, plot
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
.
.
.
plot(fig, filename = 'figure.html')
display(HTML('figure.html')
```

Note that, if viewing the file on a Jupyter Notebook session, the figure will not be displayed there (`iplot` is needed for this). However, if working on a [JupyterLab](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab) session, the figure can be displayed there using the `plot` code above by having the [JupyterLab plotly extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/tree/master/packages/plotly-extension) installed.

## How should I add cell tags to my notebooks?

You can control the behavior of Jupyter Book by putting custom tags
in the metadata of your cells. This allows you to do things like
{doc}`automatically hide code cells <../content/hiding>`) as well as
{ref}`adding interactive widgets to cells <launch/thebelab>`.

There are two straightforward ways to add metadata to cells:

1. **Use the Jupyter Notebook cell tag editor**. The Jupyter Notebook ships with a
   cell tag editor by default. This lets you add cell tags to each cell quickly.

   To enable the cell tag editor, go click `View -> Cell Toolbar -> Tags`. This
   will enable the tags UI. Here's what the menu looks like.

2. **Use the JupyterLab Cell Tags plugin**. JupyterLab is an IDE-like Jupyter
   environment that runs in your browser. It has a "cell tags" plugin built-in,
   which exposes a user interface that lets you quickly insert cell tags.

   You'll find tags under the "wrench" menu section.
