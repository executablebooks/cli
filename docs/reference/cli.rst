The command-line interface
==========================

Jupyter Book comes with a command-line interface that makes it easy to
build your books and run a few common functions. This page contains information
about what you can do with the CLI.

.. note::

   You may also use a short-hand for ``jupyter-book`` in the command-line
   interface: ``jb``. For example: ``jupyter-book build mybook/` is equivalent
   to ``jb build mybook/``

.. click:: jupyter_book.commands:main
   :prog: jupyter-book
   :show-nested:
