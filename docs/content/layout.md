# Control the page layout

```{warning}
Many of the features on this page are experimental, and may change.
```

There are a few ways to control the layout of a page with Jupyter Book. Many of these
ideas take inspiration from the [Edward Tufte layout CSS guide](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).

Let's begin with a sample plot. You can click the toggle button to the right
to see the code that generated it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

def make_fig(figsize):
    from matplotlib import rcParams, cycler
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    plt.ion()

    # Fixing random state for reproducibility
    np.random.seed(19680801)

    N = 10
    data = [np.logspace(0, 1, 100) + .2 * np.random.randn(100) + ii for ii in range(N)]
    data = np.array(data).T
    cmap = plt.cm.coolwarm
    rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler(color=cmap(np.linspace(0, 1, N)))


    from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
    custom_lines = [Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(0.), lw=4),
                    Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(.5), lw=4),
                    Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(1.), lw=4)]

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)
    lines = ax.plot(data)
    ax.legend(custom_lines, ['Cold', 'Medium', 'Hot'])
make_fig(figsize=(10, 5))
```

(layout/sidebar)=
## Sidebar content

Adding sidebar elements allow you to provide contextual information that doesn't break
up the flow of your main content. It is one of the main patterns recommended in the
[Tufte style guide](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).

There are two kinds of sidebars supported in Jupyter Book, which we'll
describe below.

```{note}
Some Sidebar content behaves differently depending on the screen size. If the screen is narrow
enough, the sidebar content will exist in-line with your content. Make the screen
wider and it'll pop out to the right.
```

### Within-content sidebars

To add within-content sidebars, use this syntax:

```{sidebar} My sidebar title
My sidebar content
```

The sidebar will stay in-line with your page's content, but will be
placed to the right, allowing your content to wrap around it. This prevents
the sidebar from brekaing up the flow of your content.

````
```{sidebar} My sidebar title
My sidebar content
```
````

### Margin content

To add margin content with myst markdown, use this syntax:

````
```{margin} An optional title
My margin content
```
````

`````{margin} **For example**
Here's some margin content! It was created by using the
````
```{margin}
```
````
directive in a markdown cell. Jupyter Book automatically converts these
cells into helpful side content.
`````

Controlling margin content with code cells uses a slightly different pattern,
which we'll cover below.

### Margins with code cells

You can make a code cell move to the right margin by adding `margin` to your
cell's tags. Here's what the cell metadata for a margin cell looks like:

```json
{
    "tags": [
        "margin",
    ]
}
```

For example, we'll re-display the figure above, and add a `margin` tag to the code cell.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [margin]

make_fig(figsize=(10, 5))
```

This can be combined with other tags like `remove-input` to **only display the figure**.

## Scrolling cell outputs

The traditional Jupyter Notebook interface allows you to toggle **output scrolling**
for your cells. This allows you to visualize part of a long output without it taking up
the entire page.

You can trigger this behavior in Jupyter Book by adding the following
tag to a cell's metadata:


```json
{
    "tags": [
        "output_scroll",
    ]
}
```

For example, the following cell has a long output, but will be scrollable in the book.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [output_scroll]

for ii in range(40):
    print(f"this is output line {ii}")
```

## Wide-format content

Sometimes, you'd like to use **all** of the horizontal space available to you. This allows
you to highlight particular ideas, visualizations, etc.

In Jupyter Book, you can specify that the outputs of a cell (if it's a code cell) or the entire
cell (if it's a markdown cell) should take up all of
the horizonal space (including the margin to the right) using the
following cell metadata tag:

```json
{
    "tags": [
        "full-width",
    ]
}
```

This works equally well on markdown cells, or with code cells.

For example, let's take a look at the figure at full-width. We'll tell Matplotlib
to make it a bit wider so we can take advantage of the extra space!

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input, full-width]

make_fig(figsize=(20, 5))
```

This can work with markdown cells as well. For example, we'll make the following warning block full-width so that
it draws more attention:

+++ {"tags": ["full-width"]}

```{admonition} **Be careful about mixing popouts and full-width content**.
:class: full-width

Sometimes these can conflict
with one another in visual space. You should use them relatively sparingly in order
for them to have their full effect of highlighting information.
```
